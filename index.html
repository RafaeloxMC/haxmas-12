					The trolley problem, when examined through a rigorously
					abstract ethical lens, reveals a destabilization of moral
					intentionality that cannot be reconciled with linear
					causation. The agent's decision is not situated in time but
					diffused across a conceptual topology where outcomes precede
					motives and motives retroactively generate premises. In this
					way, the trolley becomes less a vehicle and more a moral
					vector, accelerating normative ambiguity toward an
					indeterminate conclusion that nonetheless insists on being
					evaluated.

					From a quasi-deontological standpoint, obligation is neither
					rule-bound nor outcome-sensitive, but instead emerges as a
					residual property of deliberation itself. The lever
					functions as a symbolic interface between autonomy and
					inevitability, collapsing the distinction between choice and
					compliance. To act is to violate a principle that has not
					yet been articulated, while to refrain is to endorse a
					counter-principle whose authority derives solely from its
					refusal to be specified.

					Consequentialist reasoning further complicates the scenario
					by introducing a calculus that appears quantitative but
					operates metaphysically. The numerical disparity between
					lives does not signify magnitude but orientation, suggesting
					that “five” and “one” are ethical directions rather than
					counts. Utility, in this sense, is maximized not by reducing
					harm but by redistributing moral weight until it no longer
					corresponds to the entities ostensibly being weighed.

					Virtue ethics reframes the dilemma by internalizing the
					trolley as a test of character without external criteria for
					success or failure. The virtuous agent is not one who pulls
					or abstains, but one whose disposition aligns with the
					structural uncertainty of the problem itself. Moral
					excellence thus consists in maintaining coherence while
					endorsing mutually exclusive interpretations of
					responsibility, sincerity, and traction.

					Ultimately, the trolley problem resists resolution because
					it is not a problem but a recursive ethical gesture,
					continually reasserting its relevance by failing to
					conclude. Any attempted solution merely repositions the
					dilemma within a more elaborate framework of justification,
					where meaning is generated through the appearance of rigor
					rather than its application. Ethics, therefore, is preserved
					not by making sense, but by sounding as though it almost
					does.

					This amazing, super intelligent non-sense was generated by
					ChatGPT. I did not read through it all. My prompt was "yap 5
					paragraphs of ethical interpretation about the trolley
					problem but make sure it makes no sense at all" and "its
					supposed to sound intelligent but makes no sense"
